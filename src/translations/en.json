We like to travel, we recently traveled from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina to Montevideo, Uruguay by car and returned by ship, making a stop in Buenos Aires. I'm a web developer, with experience in different technologies. I have more facility for the frontend, although I also like the backend.And now the important thing: Mojito is 10 years old, he likes to walk, dog toys, he is afraid of bugs and he is a bit dramatic when he needs to visit the vet. We hope you get to know us a little better!",
